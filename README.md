# logodropper
proof of concept for logo multi search (visual, text, filename, category), AHK v2, HTML CSS JS

Requires each of the following:

For webview2:
https://github.com/thqby/ahk2_lib

For the Excel File macro to work:
https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON

and even though it gives you an error, I believe you not only need to import the createJSON.bas, but I think you also need to referecne it (which will error, ignore it as otherwise I couldnt get it to run on two machines)
